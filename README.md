Quotes App
### Author

## Project Description
This is a website for reading and adding quotes. It is here where one lands on the Quotes-App. One will be able to see the posted quotes and post their own quotes.
The main languages used for the project are Typescript, Html, css and javascript.


## Project setup instructions
Quotes-App uses VScode, Atom , notepad++ and sublime text3 editors. This therefore implies that one is needed to have either of the editors installed in their machines/computers so as to be able to run the program.
All interested people are advised to create a branch on gitHub and clone this project and make any necessary improvements. On my trial branch, you shall merge the two branches to have your improvements reflected. I will be so grateful.
